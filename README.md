# Sample AWS Lambda function for Alexa
A simple [AWS Lambda](http://aws.amazon.com/lambda) function that demonstrates how to write a skill for the Amazon Echo using the Alexa SDK.

## Concepts
This simple sample has no external dependencies or session management, and shows the most basic example of how to create a Lambda function for handling Alexa Skill requests.

## Local Verification

Run the Lambda response tests before packaging changes:

```sh
npm test
```

The tests use Node's built-in test runner and do not require AWS credentials or
third-party npm packages.

## Configuration

Set `ALEXA_SKILL_ID` when you want the Lambda to reject requests from any other
Alexa skill application id:

```sh
export ALEXA_SKILL_ID='amzn1.echo-sdk-ams.app.your-skill-id'
```

Leaving `ALEXA_SKILL_ID` unset preserves the sample behavior and skips app-id
validation.

## Setup
To run this example skill you need to do two things. The first is to deploy the example code in lambda, and the second is to configure the Alexa skill to use Lambda.

### AWS Lambda Setup
1. Go to the AWS Console and click on the Lambda link. Note: ensure you are in us-east or you won't be able to use Alexa with Lambda.
2. Click on the Create a Lambda Function or Get Started Now button.
3. Skip the blueprint
4. Name the Lambda Function "Hello-World-Example-Skill".
5. Select the runtime as Node.js
5. Go to the the src directory, select all files and then create a zip file, make sure the zip file does not contain the src directory itself, otherwise Lambda function will not work.
6. Select Code entry type as "Upload a .ZIP file" and then upload the .zip file to the Lambda
7. Keep the Handler as index.handler (this refers to the main js file in the zip).
8. Create a basic execution role and click create.
9. Leave the Advanced settings as the defaults.
10. Click "Next" and review the settings then click "Create Function"
11. Click the "Event Sources" tab and select "Add event source"
12. Set the Event Source type as Alexa Skills kit and Enable it now. Click Submit.
13. Copy the ARN from the top right to be used later in the Alexa Skill Setup

### Alexa Skill Setup
1. Go to the [Alexa Console](https://developer.amazon.com/edw/home.html) and click Add a New Skill.
2. Set "HelloWorld" as the skill name and "hello world" as the invocation name, this is what is used to activate your skill. For example you would say: "Alexa, tell Hello World to say hello"
3. Select the Lambda ARN for the skill Endpoint and paste the ARN copied from above. Click Next.
4. Copy the Intent Schema from the included IntentSchema.json.
5. Copy the Sample Utterances from the included SampleUtterances.txt. Click Next.
6. [optional] go back to the skill Information tab and copy the appId. Configure it as `ALEXA_SKILL_ID` for the Lambda environment, then update the lambda source zip file and upload to lambda again. This step makes sure the lambda function only serves requests from the authorized source.
7. You are now able to start testing your sample skill! You should be able to go to the [Echo webpage](http://echo.amazon.com/#skills) and see your skill enabled.
8. In order to test it, try to say some of the Sample Utterances from the Examples section below.
9. Your skill is now saved and once you are finished testing you can continue to publish your skill.

## Examples
    User: "Alexa, tell Hello World to say hello"
    Alexa: "Hello World!"
